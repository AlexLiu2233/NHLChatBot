Can you help me with the Front end of my REACT application?

I will share the LoginPage, the App, and the Service of the Front End.
Furthermore, I will include the Database, Session Manager, and Srver of the Backend

The LoginPage, once the password game is passed and the user then verified (setAuthenticate is true)

->The user is redirected to the LobbyView Page
