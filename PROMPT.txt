Can you help me with the Front end of my REACT application?

I will share the LoginPage, the App, the Service, and the LobbyView of the Front End.
Furthermore, I will include the Database, Session Manager, and Srver of the Backend

The end goal is to have the user input some info (To begin with, starting with a name)
The AI will take this prompt and generate a wiki style summary of the player, with a key focus based on the teamname of the chatroom currently in (ChatView)

Lets begin by fixing the connections. Currently, I am getting the following error when navigating to the ChatView page"
LobbyView.js:40  Error fetching rooms: TypeError: n is not a function
    at LobbyView.js:38:9
(anonymous) @ LobbyView.js:40
LobbyView.js:41  Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: n is not a function
    at LobbyView.js:41:9

Can you begin by helping me to debug this problem, and get my Chatrooms loaded please? Thanks!

Let me know if you require any other information from me
